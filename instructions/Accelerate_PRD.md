# Accelerate - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Accelerate  
**Concept:** A text-based group chat environment where one user interacts with a panel of AI agents (CEO, CTO, CMO, CFO, COO, etc.) that provide expert feedback on startup ideas. Users can simply submit an idea and receive sequential responses based on each agent's expertise. A command (e.g., **@channel**) forces all agents to respond. The agents maintain chat memory so that as the user refines their idea, the feedback evolves accordingly.

## Key Features
- **Single-User Group Chat:**  
  Only one user interacts with the AI agents in a dedicated chat session (no live human-to-human chat).

- **Agent Roles & Response Behavior:**  
  - **Default Responses:** Each agent responds when the idea/question aligns with their domain.
  - **Forced Group Response:** The **@channel** command triggers all agents to respond regardless of the ideaâ€™s subject.
  
- **Text-Only Interface:**  
  Pure text-based input and output for quick MVP development.

- **Sequential Conversation Flow:**  
  Agents respond in an order defined by the prompt logic (e.g., CEO for overall vision, followed by CTO, etc.) to create a coherent, human-like dialogue.

- **Chat Memory:**  
  Retains conversation context so that feedback deepens as the discussion evolves.

- **Minimal UI/UX:**  
  A clean, minimal, neumorphism-inspired design for clarity and ease-of-use.

## User Journey Walkthrough
1. **Idea Submission:**  
   The user submits their startup idea or question.
2. **Initial Agent Responses:**  
   Relevant AI agents respond sequentially based on the idea content.
3. **Force Response Option:**  
   The **@channel** command triggers responses from all agents.
4. **Output Display:**  
   The chat window displays the conversation sequentially with clear agent identification.
5. **Iterative Refinement:**  
   The user refines their idea, prompting more in-depth, context-aware feedback.
